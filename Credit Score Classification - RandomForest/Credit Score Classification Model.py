#Let’s have a look at the information about the columns in the dataset:
data.info()

#Before moving forward, let’s have a look if the dataset has any null values or not:
data.isnull().sum()    

#The dataset doesn’t have any null values. As this dataset is labelled, 
#let’s have a look at the Credit_Score column values:
data["Credit_Score"].value_counts()



#I will start by exploring the occupation feature to know 
#if the occupation of the person affects credit scores:
fig= px.box(data,
             x="Occupation",
             color = "Credit_Score",
             title ="Credit Scores Based on Occupation",
             color_discrete_map = {"Poor":"red",
                                 "Standard" :"yellow",
                                 "Good" : "green"})
fig.show()
#There’s not much difference in the credit scores of all occupations mentioned in the data.

#Now let’s explore whether the Annual Income of the person impacts your credit scores or not:
fig = px.box(data,
             x = "Credit_Score",
             y = "Annual_Income",
             color = "Credit_Score",
             title ="Credit Scores Based on Annual Income",
             color_discrete_map = {"Poor":"red",
                                 "Standard" :"yellow",
                                 "Good" : "green"})
fig.update_traces(quartilemethod = "exclusive")
fig.show()          
#According to the above visualization, the more you earn annually, the better your credit score is.


#Now let’s explore whether the monthly in-hand salary impacts credit scores or not:
fig = px.box(data,
             x = "Credit_Score",
             y = "Monthly_Inhand_Salary",
             color = "Credit_Score",
             title ="Credit Scores Based on Monthly_Inhand_Salary",
             color_discrete_map = {"Poor":"red",
                                 "Standard" :"yellow",
                                 "Good" : "green"})
fig.update_traces(quartilemethod = "exclusive")
fig.show()

#ike annual income, the more monthly in-hand salary you earn, the better your credit score will become.


#Now let’s see if having more bank accounts impacts credit scores or not:
fig = px.box(data,
             x = "Credit_Score",
             y = "Num_Bank_Accounts",
             color = "Credit_Score",

                                 "Good" : "green"})
fig.update_traces(quartilemethod = "exclusive")
fig.show()
#Maintaining more than five accounts is not good for having a good credit score
#A person should have 2 – 3 bank accounts only. So having more bank accounts doesn’t positively impact credit scores. 


#Now let’s see the impact on credit scores based on the number of credit cards you have:
fig = px.box(data,
             x = "Credit_Score",
             y = "Num_Credit_Cars",
             color = "Credit_Score",
             title ="Credit Scores Based on Num_Credit_Cards",
             color_discrete_map = {"Poor":"red",
                                 "Standard" :"yellow",
                                 "Good" : "green"})
fig.update_traces(quartilemethod = "exclusive")
fig.show()
#justlike bank accounts, having more credit cards will not positively impact your credit scores
#Having 3 – 5 credit cards is good for your credit score.


#Now let’s see the impact on credit scores based on how much average interest you pay on loans and EMIs:
fig = px.box(data,
             x = "Credit_Score",
             y = "Interest_Rate",
             color = "Credit_Score",
             title ="Credit Scores Based on Interest Rates",
             color_discrete_map = {"Poor":"red",
                                 "Standard" :"yellow",
                                 "Good" : "green"})
fig.update_traces(quartilemethod = "exclusive")
fig.show()
#If the average interest rate is 4 – 11%, the credit score is good.
#Having an average interest rate of more than 15% is bad for your credit scores.


#Now let’s see how many loans you can take at a time for a good credit score:
fig = px.box(data,
             x = "Credit_Score",
             y = "Num_of_Loan",
             color = "Credit_Score",
             title ="Credit Scores Based on Num of Loans",
             color_discrete_map = {"Poor":"red",
                                 "Standard" :"yellow",
                                 "Good" : "green"})
fig.update_traces(quartilemethod = "exclusive")
fig.show()    
#To have a good credit score, you should not take more than 1 – 3 loans at a time.
#Having more than three loans at a time will negatively impact your credit scores.


# Now let’s see if delaying payments on the due date impacts your credit scores or not:
fig = px.box(data,
             x = "Credit_Score",
             y = "Delay_from_due_date",
             color = "Credit_Score",
             title ="Credit Scores Based Average Number of Days Delayed for Credit card Payments",
             color_discrete_map = {"Poor":"red",
                                 "Standard" :"yellow",
                                 "Good" : "green"})
fig.update_traces(quartilemethod = "exclusive")
fig.show()        
#So you can delay your credit card payment 5 – 14 days from the due date.
#Delaying your payments for more than 17 days from the due date will impact your credit scores negatively.


#Now let’s have a look at if frequently delaying payments will impact credit scores or not:
fig = px.box(data, 
             x="Credit_Score", 
             y="Num_of_Delayed_Payment", 
             color="Credit_Score", 
             title="Credit Scores Based on Number of Delayed Payments",
             color_discrete_map={'Poor':'red',
                                 'Standard':'yellow',
                                 'Good':'green'})
fig.update_traces(quartilemethod="exclusive")
fig.show()    
#So delaying 4 – 12 payments from the due date will not affect your credit scores.
#But delaying more than 12 payments from the due date will affect your credit scores negatively.


#Now let’s see if having more debt will affect credit scores or not:
fig = px.box(data, 
             x="Credit_Score", 
             y="Outstanding_Debt", 
             color="Credit_Score", 
             title="Credit Scores Based on Outstanding Debt",
             color_discrete_map={'Poor':'red',
                                 'Standard':'yellow',
                                 'Good':'green'})
fig.update_traces(quartilemethod="exclusive")
fig.show()    
#n outstanding debt of $380 – $1150 will not affect your credit scores
#But always having a debt of more than $1338 will affect your credit scores negatively.


#Now let’s see if having a high credit utilization ratio will affect credit scores or not:
fig = px.box(data, 
             x="Credit_Score", 
             y="Credit_Utilization_Ratio", 
             color="Credit_Score",
             title="Credit Scores Based on Credit Utilization Ratio", 
             color_discrete_map={'Poor':'red',
                                 'Standard':'yellow',
                                 'Good':'green'})
fig.update_traces(quartilemethod="exclusive")
fig.show()    
# Credit utilization ratio means your total debt divided by your total available credit.
# According to the above figure, your credit utilization ratio doesn’t affect your credit scores.


#Now let’s see how the credit history age of a person affects credit scores:
fig = px.box(data, 
             x="Credit_Score", 
             y="Credit_History_Age", 
             color="Credit_Score", 
             title="Credit Scores Based on Credit History Age",
             color_discrete_map={'Poor':'red',
                                 'Standard':'yellow',
                                 'Good':'green'})
fig.update_traces(quartilemethod="exclusive")
fig.show()
#So, having a long credit history results in better credit scores.


#Now let’s see how many EMIs you can have in a month for a good credit score:
fig = px.box(data, 
             x="Credit_Score", 
             y="Total_EMI_per_month", 
             color="Credit_Score", 
             title="Credit Scores Based on Total Number of EMIs per Month",
             color_discrete_map={'Poor':'red',
                                 'Standard':'yellow',
                                 'Good':'green'})
fig.update_traces(quartilemethod="exclusive")
fig.show()
#The number of EMIs you are paying in a month doesn’t affect much on credit scores.


#Now let’s see if your monthly investments affect your credit scores or not:
fig = px.box(data, 
             x="Credit_Score", 
             y="Amount_invested_monthly", 
             color="Credit_Score", 
             title="Credit Scores Based on Amount Invested Monthly",
             color_discrete_map={'Poor':'red',
                                 'Standard':'yellow',
                                 'Good':'green'})
fig.update_traces(quartilemethod="exclusive")
fig.show()    
#he amount of money you invest monthly doesn’t affect your credit scores a lot.


#Now let’s see if having a low amount at the end of the month affects credit scores or not:
fig = px.box(data, 
             x="Credit_Score", 
             y="Monthly_Balance", 
             color="Credit_Score", 
             title="Credit Scores Based on Monthly Balance Left",
             color_discrete_map={'Poor':'red',
                                 'Standard':'yellow',
                                 'Good':'green'})
fig.update_traces(quartilemethod="exclusive")
fig.show()    
#So, having a high monthly balance in your account at the end of the month is good for your credit scores.
#A monthly balance of less than $250 is bad for credit scores.



                        #Credit Score Classification Model

#As the Credit_Mix column is categorical, I will transform it into a numerical feature
#so that we can use it to train a Machine Learning model for the task of credit score classification:


data["Credit_Mix"] = data["Credit_Mix"].map({"Standart":1,
                                             "Good":2,
                                             "Bad":0})
data


#Now I will split the data into features and labels by selecting the features we found important for our model:
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

x = np.array(data[["Annual_Income", "Monthly_Inhand_Salary", 
                   "Num_Bank_Accounts", "Num_Credit_Card", 
                   "Interest_Rate", "Num_of_Loan", 
                   "Delay_from_due_date", "Num_of_Delayed_Payment", 
                   "Credit_Mix", "Outstanding_Debt", 
                   "Credit_History_Age", "Monthly_Balance"]])

y = np.array(data[["Credit_Score"]])


#Now, let’s split the data into training and test sets and proceed further
#by training a credit score classification model:

x_train,x_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(x, y, 
                                                    test_size=0.33, 
                                                    random_state=42)
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(x_train,y_train)


#Now, let’s make predictions from our model by giving inputs to our model according
#to the features we used to train the model:

print("Credit Score Prediction : ")
a = float(input("Annual Income: "))
b = float(input("Monthly Inhand Salary: "))
c = float(input("Number of Bank Accounts: "))
d = float(input("Number of Credit cards: "))
e = float(input("Interest rate: "))
f = float(input("Number of Loans: "))
g = float(input("Average number of days delayed by the person: "))
h = float(input("Number of delayed payments: "))
i = input("Credit Mix (Bad: 0, Standard: 1, Good: 3) : ")
j = float(input("Outstanding Debt: "))
k = float(input("Credit History Age: "))
l = float(input("Monthly Balance: "))

features = np.array([[a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l]])
print("Predicted Credit Score = ", model.predict(features))




#Summary
#Classifying customers based on their credit scores helps banks and credit card
#companies immediately to issue loans to customers with good creditworthiness
 # A person with a good credit score will get loans from any bank and financial institution.
